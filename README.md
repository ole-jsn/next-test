## ✨ EXTRA INFO

-   🤖 In order to send messages as the bot, the bot must have sent an automated message before (from Botpress Studio)
-   🌐 You can use this project on your localhost only (it works perfectly), or you could host it for free on a platform like Vercel/Netlify, in which case you would need to restrict access with native authentication from the platform (easier), or using JWT/Cookies.
